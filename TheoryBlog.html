    <h2><i>The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord, 1967:</i></h2>
    <p>I found the reading to be dense at points, but was taken aback with its timeless accuracy. The Spectacle, as Guy Debord describes it, is today’s modern consumption economy, but more accurately it is a more complex compilation of symbols and ideas. Though it cannot be everything, it is autonomous in its nature and exists in the present, influencing and aligning society’s perception of the truth. It is the driving force in the production of present day society and social relations. The spectacle’s means, and goal itself, is the act of separation. Debord notes this separation from ourselves, each other, and our labor.</p>
    <i>Points I found fascinating:</i>

<p>The spectacle has transformed social life from “being into having” (17), then having into appearing. The falsified reality of influencer culture in producing a “perfect body” with actually <i>having one</i> is a direct experience permeating through society today. As a result of capitalism, the goal and function of the spectacle is to abstract and degrade. You do not need to “have” anymore, appearances themselves have now taken on intrinsic social value.</p> 
<p>“The point where the spectacle inverts the real, in fact is produced” (8) reminds me of a modern day issue AI has confronted us with. Ideas of legitimacy and truth are now in question, by fault of the cloud computing era. The statement, “Within a world really on its head, the true is a moment of the false” (9) exemplifies how the spectacle is not limited by an adherence to objective reality; this is displayed in real time with Trump's “retruths”. With new technologies we can make illusions real, leaving the door open for a reordering of what is true and what is false.</p>
<p>The community spaces, such as markets, have since been replaced, in the wake of mechanical reproduction, with an “abundance of dispossession” (31). Manufacturers such as Shein have eliminated high quality clothing with the abundance of season-to-season availability. Value has been shifted from the quality of substance to the abundance of substance. Furthermore, the promise of capitalism was to facilitate ways to increase production and eliminate our needs, but we now live in a world where companies like Shein manufacture scarcity.</p> 
<p>As we have stepped away from previous generations' threats, we continue to manufacture new needs to ensure survival. “The abundance of commodities, that is, the commodity relation, can be no more than augmented survival” (40). Whereas, in the past, commodities represented resource availability and therefore how capable a society was to survive, this quote displays excess commodification as an inherent function of capitalism, driving consumers to create new threats to modern survival and new commodities to help remedy that.</p>

    <h2><i>In Defense of the Poor Image by Hito Steyerl, 2011:</i></h2>
    <p>The article explores what constitutes a poor image and what that means in the digital age. Visual culture has been largely produced from “systems of national culture, capitalist studio production, the cult of mostly male genius, and the original version” (3). The poor image, as mentioned throughout this reading, has developed tremendously in terms of the art itself, and the modes to which it is distributed. The poor image more or less has become valuable. When reading this article, I was pleasantly reminded of the summers I spent visiting family in Mexico City. I remember the excitement of looking forward to our trips to the panadería. Not only was I allowed to get whatever sweet treat I wanted, but I was able to browse the table full of bootlog movies just outside of the   panadería. With my personal interest in archival work, I appreciate the images from the past, because to me, it holds intrinsic value over the lack of. Therefore I ask, is the poor image justified under the context of archival work? If not, why do we continue to uphold the pristine image and what does that mean for the bodies of work produced now in 20 years time? The poor image will continue to encompass more art as technology and society progress, leaving the poor image to become a symbol of both the democratization of media and the degradation of traditional and visual standards.
