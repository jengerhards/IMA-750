    <h2><i>The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord, 1967:</i></h2>
    <p>I found the reading to be dense at points, but was taken aback with its timeless accuracy. The Spectacle, as Guy Debord describes it, is today’s modern consumption economy, but more accurately it is a more complex compilation of symbols and ideas. Though it cannot be everything, it is autonomous in its nature and exists in the present, influencing and aligning society’s perception of the truth. It is the driving force in the production of present day society and social relations. The spectacle’s means, and goal itself, is the act of separation. Debord notes this separation from ourselves, each other, and our labor.</p>
    <i>Points I found fascinating:</i>

<p>The spectacle has transformed social life from “being into having” (17), then having into appearing. The falsified reality of influencer culture in producing a “perfect body” with actually <i>having one</i> is a direct experience permeating through society today. As a result of capitalism, the goal and function of the spectacle is to abstract and degrade. You do not need to “have” anymore, appearances themselves have now taken on intrinsic social value.</p> 
<p>“The point where the spectacle inverts the real, in fact is produced” (8) reminds me of a modern day issue AI has confronted us with. Ideas of legitimacy and truth are now in question, by fault of the cloud computing era. The statement, “Within a world really on its head, the true is a moment of the false” (9) exemplifies how the spectacle is not limited by an adherence to objective reality; this is displayed in real time with Trump's “retruths”. With new technologies we can make illusions real, leaving the door open for a reordering of what is true and what is false.</p>
<p>The community spaces, such as markets, have since been replaced, in the wake of mechanical reproduction, with an “abundance of dispossession” (31). Manufacturers such as Shein have eliminated high quality clothing with the abundance of season-to-season availability. Value has been shifted from the quality of substance to the abundance of substance. Furthermore, the promise of capitalism was to facilitate ways to increase production and eliminate our needs, but we now live in a world where companies like Shein manufacture scarcity.</p> 
<p>As we have stepped away from previous generations' threats, we continue to manufacture new needs to ensure survival. “The abundance of commodities, that is, the commodity relation, can be no more than augmented survival” (40). Whereas, in the past, commodities represented resource availability and therefore how capable a society was to survive, this quote displays excess commodification as an inherent function of capitalism, driving consumers to create new threats to modern survival and new commodities to help remedy that.</p>

    <h2><i>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction by Walter Benjamin, 1935:</i></h2>
    <p>The overall theme I gathered was the reproduction of art using mechanical means and the social implications of said reproduction. The text discusses the historical component where art forms were closely tied to ritualistic practices serving the broader societal functions. With art becoming more widely reproduced, the author suggests that the works' innate aura diminishes. This term is used to describe the unique presence and authenticity of an original work. In contemporary speech, “aura farming”has been used to describe a person intentionally doing something and/or performing to appear “cool”. Aura is subjective as what we give our attention to can be different from the next person. </p>
    <p>An important quote that is central to Benjamin’s essay is, “That which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art” (4). He refers to the art works aura as its unique presence in society. Mechanical reproduction such as photography or film, strips art of that singular presence since copies can be made infinitely. This has fundamentally altered our relationship with art. 
    <p>Mechanical reproduction has allowed mass distribution, thus changing who and when art can be accessed. With this new level of circulation, questions about the authenticity and originality, which were previously linked to value, have emerged. Recently, I began watching youtuber Mina Le, who specializes in video essays. She uploaded a video titled, “Does originality still exist anymore?”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9VFaJP8UUI&t=664s where she unpacks modern advertisements recycling ideas from the past. Advertisements today have eliminated the genius of originality, replacing it for society's ability to recall and relate. The ability to reproduce and disseminate original works so easily and quickly has made the landscape of ideas and images to draw from massive. With this abundance of choice and access to these images, we have lost value in the original. Everything becomes up for grabs and allows for forces to commoditize and advertise images and styles unlike previous eras.</p>
    <p>*Edited 9.30* In class notes: Exhibition value vs cult value was really interesting! Cult value is about worship and presence; Exhibition value is about visibility and display.</p>

  <h2><i>In Defense of the Poor Image by Hito Steyerl, 2011:</i></h2>
    <p>The article explores what constitutes a poor image and what that means in the digital age. Visual culture, as it notes, has long been produced within “systems of national culture, capitalist studio production, the cult of mostly male genius, and the original version” (3). The poor image, however, has evolved significantly, both as an artistic form and through the ways it circulates. In many ways, the poor image has gained its own kind of value. Reading this piece reminded me of the summers I spent visiting family in Mexico City and the excitement of stopping by the local panadería. Not only was I allowed to get whatever sweet treat I wanted, but I was able to browse the table full of bootlog movies set up just outside. With my personal interest in archival work, I have come to appreciate these imperfect images from the past because they hold an intrinsic value that transcends technical quality. This leads me to wonder: is the poor image justified within the context of archival work? If not, why do we continue to uphold the pristine image, and what will that mean for the bodies of work produced twenty years from now? As technology and society continue to evolve, the poor image will likely encompass more forms of art, ultimately symbolizing both the democratization of media and the degradation of traditional visual standards.</p>
