    <h2><i>The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord, 1967:</i></h2>
    <p>I found the reading to be dense at points, but was taken aback with its timeless accuracy. The Spectacle, as Guy Debord describes it, is today’s modern consumption economy, but more accurately it is a more complex compilation of symbols and ideas. Though it cannot be everything, it is autonomous in its nature and exists in the present, influencing and aligning society’s perception of the truth. It is the driving force in the production of present day society and social relations. The spectacle’s means, and goal itself, is the act of separation. Debord notes this separation from ourselves, each other, and our labor./p>

    <h2><i>In Defense of the Poor Image by Hito Steyerl, 2011:</i></h2>
    <p>The article explores what constitutes as a poor image and what that means in the digital age. Visual culture has been largely extracted from “systems of national culture, capitalist studio production, the cult of mostly male genius, and the original version” (3). </p>
