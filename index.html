<p><b>Jennifer Gerhards</b> is a multimedia enthusiast based in Brooklyn, New York. Currently, Jennifer is pursuing her MA in Cultural Anthropology, with a concentration on food as a means of building nationhood and promoting cultural identity. In her undergraduate education at Virginia Tech, she earned her BS in Agricultural Economics and Horticulture. Jennifer plans to encompass her knowledge in supply chain logistics, consumer purchasing trends, food production, and social habits to understand the phenomenon of fusion food culture experienced globally.
<br>
Outside of her formal education, Jennifer's artistry has long been a secondary focus. She believed her identity was meant to be celebrated through her achievements in S.T.E.M., leaving her passion for the arts as little more than a hobby. However, after much personal reflection, she has discovered ways in which her two worlds can collide seamlessly. In 2022, Jennifer launched her business, Centripetal Buckets, one-of-one handmade bucket hats. In producing these, she dabbles in: sewing, painting, dying, and applying heat transfer vinyls. She also edits original animated elevator pitches to accompany each hat, blending her technical and artistic skills.  
<br>
Upon graduation, she anticipates producing long-form video essays that explore the various perspectives and politics of fusion food, a subject that reflects both her cultural curiosity and her interdisciplinary approach to storytelling.
